# Machine Learning project for CS-C3240 (Machine Learning D)
Welcome to my first machine learning project! In this project, I try two machine learning methods which are logistic regression and k-nearest neighbors algorithms to predict maternal health risk. 
The goal of this project was to gain understanding and experience with machine learning methods and the workflow in a beginner-friendly way.

## Folder Structure
- 'src/': Contains the main script (main.py) to run the machine learning methods and generate the results.
- 'doc/': Contains a more detailed explanation and analysis of the project.
- 'data/': Contains the dataset used in this project (The data is from UCI Machine Learning Repository but the link in the project no longer works)

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python packages:
- pandas (and numpy)
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
(The last two are only needed for the plots)

## How to Use
Run the `main.py` script under the directory 'src' to execute the machine learning methods. The results will include F1-scores, confusion matrices, and results from the loss functions.
